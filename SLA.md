# Service Level Agreement for MiniTwit Application Users
## v1.0.0 - 23/05/2023

### Goal 
- Successful use of the app by the group 

### What is provided?
- The service provided is the social media application Minitwit. 

### Who provided the service? 
- The service provider is the Bango team. 

### Who are the intended users?
- Users of the social media platform. 

### Metrics of interest: 
- Given that we want to provide a functioning platform, we want to measure based on uptime and amount of errors. Response time to errors and bugs should be kept at a minimum. 

### Performance of metrics: 
- We aim for the highest amount of uptime possible and the lowest amount of errors possible. There is no guarantee for the amount of uptime or the amount of errors generated. Response time is not guaranteed, it is aimed at being minimized. 

### Consequences of failed targets. 
- The Bango team assumes no liability for metrics not performing to customers' standards. Bug reports: The Bango team aims at looking through GitHub issues on https://github.com/organizationGB/DevOps/issues. Response time is as stated not guaranteed but aimed to be minimized. Review process: The Bango team aims to reassess this SLA once every 6 months, to adjust for more strict metrics or changes needed.
