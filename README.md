## üìù Notes from lectures!

### **Lecture 1Ô∏è‚É£**
<hr/>

* We converted from python 2 -> 3. Simply by trying to run it and then correct where the compliler complained.
* We changed print statement! Just itereated over each complie error. Also we changed the .control file (added a 3 and ""). 
* We forgot to change the test file!
* (Good to use 2To3 on that test file)

### **Lecture 2Ô∏è‚É£**
<hr/>

* We went though the docker exercise and started talking about how to structure our git (having a folder for the old minitwit application and another one for the one we are refactoring). 
* We creating a docker file and refactoring to Go.
* We also want to use postgres because it is a well known database and easy to implement in docker.
