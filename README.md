#NOTES from lectures! 

----------- LECTURE 1 -----------
We converted from python 2 -> 3. Simply by trying to run it and then correct where the compliler complained.

We changed print statement! Just itereated over each complie error. Also we changed the .control file (added a 3 and ""). 

We forgot to change the test file!
(Good to use 2To3 on that test file)

----------- LECTURE 2 -----------
We went though the docker exercise and started talking about how to structure our git (having a folder for the old minitwit application and another one for the one we are refactoring). We creating a docker file and refactoring to Go.
