#NOTES from lectures! 

----------- LECTURE 1 -----------
We converted from python 2 -> 3. Simply by trying to run it and then correct where the compliler complained.

We changed print statement! Just itereated over each complie error. Also we changed the .control file (added a 3 and ""). 

We forgot to change the test file!
(Good to use 2To3 on that test file)
