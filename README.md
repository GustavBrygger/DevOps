<br/>

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quickstart!

```sh
cd minitwit-go
docker-compose up
```
`docker-compose up` runs both the database and the server


If files have been changed, then instead run
```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

  
## ENV file from github actions secret to Go 
  1. In the workflow file pass on the enviroment:
   env:
      DB_USER: ${{ secrets.DB_USERNAME }}
      DB_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.DB_PASSWORD }}
  2. In the docker-compose file you can now access these by setting enviroment:
      environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=${DB_USER}
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=${DB_PASSWORD}
  3. These can be accesed in GO by:
    postgres_user := os.Getenv("POSTGRES_USER")
    postgres_psw := os.Getenv("POSTGRES_PASSWORD")
  



## üìù Notes from lectures!

### **Lecture 1Ô∏è‚É£**
<hr/>

* We converted from python 2 -> 3. Simply by trying to run it and then correct where the compliler complained.
* We changed print statement! Just itereated over each complie error. Also we changed the .control file (added a 3 and ""). 
* We forgot to change the test file!
* (Good to use 2To3 on that test file)

### **Lecture 2Ô∏è‚É£**
<hr/>

* We went though the docker exercise and started talking about how to structure our git (having a folder for the old minitwit application and another one for the one we are refactoring). 
* We creating a docker file and refactoring to Go.
* We also want to use postgres because it is a well known database and easy to implement in docker...
