\section{Security assessment}
From our security assessment we worked on blocking the risks with the highest likelyhood. The first being \textit{An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the codebase}
- An attacker could easily find passwords and usernames at our public codebase. Now thease are in github secrets such that an adversary cannot just 
find these at the public codebase. Another precaution would be to work with the risk \textit{Weak authentication and authorization mechanisms}
 - We are using default values such as postgres as username and password for the database. These should ofc be changed to something foloowing the
 new secuirty protocols standards.
