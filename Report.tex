\section{Security assesment}
From our security assesment we worked on blocking the two risks with the most likelyhood namely \textit{Unauthorized access to the application codebase}
- an attacker could easily find passwords and usernames at our public codebase. Now thease are in github secrets such that an adversary cannot just 
find the password at the public codebase. As one precuation would be to work with the risk \textit{Weak authentication and authorization mechanisms}
 - Namely that we are using defaults values.
