\section{Security assessment}
From our security assessment we worked on blocking the risks with the highest likelihood. The first is \textit{An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the codebase}
- An attacker could easily find passwords and usernames in our public codebase. Now these are in github secrets such that an adversary cannot just 
find these at the public codebase. Another precaution would be to work with the risk \textit{Weak authentication and authorization mechanisms}
 - We are using default values such as postgres as username and password for the database. These should ofc be changed to something following the
 new security protocols standards.
